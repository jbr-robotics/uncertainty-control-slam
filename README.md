# Effective data structures for 3D SLAM

Research objective: Development and optimization of data structures for representing maps in 3D SLAM systems for use on low-power devices (e.g., micro-drones).

The main task is to create an efficient data structure capable of processing and storing information about complex three-dimensional environments in real-time while minimizing resource consumption.

It's important to consider (maybe not all at once):
- Limited computational power (we can't compute quickly)
- Energy efficiency (we can't compute for long periods)
- Limited memory (we can't process large amounts of information)

The first step is to understand the current state: conduct a comparative analysis of various data structures, such as octo-trees, graphs, and voxel models (maybe something new has emerged), to determine the most suitable solution.

The outcome of the internship could be a theoretical or experimental verification of the hypothesis about the most effective representation.
