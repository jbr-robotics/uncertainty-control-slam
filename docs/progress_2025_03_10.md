### 1. Problem Statement and Importance
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems are essential for robotic navigation and autonomous operation because they allow a robot to build a map of an environment and determine its location within it. These capabilities are critical in applications such as indoor navigation, inspection, and search-and-rescue missions. Googleâ€™s Cartographer, noted for its accuracy, is a prominent SLAM system; however, its complex parameter tuning process is a significant challenge. The need for environment-specific configurations (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor) limits its robustness. Consequently, the goal of this thesis is to develop an automated tool that searches for the optimal Cartographer parameters given a specific robot setup and environment. In the worst-case scenario, this tool will assist engineers in fine-tuning their configurations, while in the best-case scenario, it could be integrated into Cartographer for real-time dynamic tuning.
### 2. What Has Already Been Done
- **Parameter Identification:**  
    A list of the most important parameter candidates has been identified.
- **Implemented and Supported Metrics:**
    - **3D Metrics:** Mean Map Entropy, Mean Plane Variance
    - **2D Metrics:** Corner Count, Enclosed Areas Count, Occupied Proportion
    - **Relation Metrics** 
- **Datasets Supported:**  
    The system currently supports several datasets, including KITTI, HILTI, MIT Stata, and Cartographer sample data.
- **Optimization Tool:**  
    An optimization tool using a grid search approach has been implemented. This tool takes a grid of suggested parameters and computes the associated metrics for all possible combinations.
### 3. What Will Be Done
- **Submap Evaluation:**  
    Develop an evaluation process for Cartographer submaps to provide more detailed feedback.
- **Integration of 2D Evaluation in 3D SLAM:**  
    Incorporate 2D evaluation techniques into the 3D SLAM configuration process. While the best scenario targets full 3D evaluation, functionality that supports 2D configurations will also be maintained.
- **Advanced Optimization techniques:**  
    Study the applicability of advanced optimization techniques for configuration automation.
- **Real-Time Potential:**  
    The primary goal is to enhance the accuracy of Cartographer's configurations. Although reducing configuration time is a secondary priority, a faster solution could enable real-time tuning, which is a significant long-term objective.
### 4. Expected Results and Measurement

- **Range of Outcomes:**
    - **Worst-case:** The tool serves as an assistive instrument for researchers, streamlining the configuration process.
    - **Most likely:** The system automatically configures Cartographer without human intervention, produced map is compatible with human configured results. 
    - **Best-case:** The tool dynamically tunes parameters in real time.
- **Measurement Criteria:**  
    Success will be measured both by human evaluation and by the quantitative metrics (such as those listed above). Clear performance benchmarks will be established to assess improvements in configuration accuracy, with configuration time reduction as an additional, secondary measure.
